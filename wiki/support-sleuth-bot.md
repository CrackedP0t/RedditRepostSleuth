## Supporting Repost Sleuth

---

### TLDR

---

Repost Sleuth is a passion project that is expensive to run.  It costs about $40 a month in electricity.  It was just moved to a new $800 server and will soon be getting a $300 RAM upgrade. 

No obligation to donate but I would sincerely appreciate any donations.

### What's The Deal?

---

When I started this project I could never imagine how popular it would become.  I put this bot together as a fun side project thinking it might help me land a job someday.  I never thought it would get any traction.  Boy was I wrong.

The daily amount of interaction the bot gets, the amount of subs that have signed up, and the general positive support has been mind blowing. 

I am immensely grateful to the Reddit community for the love and support shown to Repost Sleuth.

To put some numbers to it. 

* Average of 3000 summons a day
* Over 180 subs signed up for monitoring, covering millions of members
* 340,000 Comments Left
* Over 40 million image searches performed 
* 20 new submissions a second are checked for reposts
* Over 400 million Reddit submissions indexed

### All of these numbers have a big downside 

The bot requires a ton of CPU power and electricity to work.  On the surface it seems simple.  You tag the bot and it responds.  Under the covers there is a lot going on. 

At any given moment there are 20 to 40 containers running to do all of the processing required.  These cover things like

* Monitoring for new mentions
* Responding to new mentions
* Ingesting every single new submission Reddit receives
* Performing repost checks on every new link and image submission (can be over 20,000+ and hour)
* Performing repost checks with custom settings on subs that are signed up for monitoring
* Collecting stats about bot performance
* Building search indexes
* And many other tasks

Most of this runs on a Dell enterprise grade server in my house.  What the server can't handle is currently being picked up by my gaming PC. 

I'd like to add new features like OC theft detection and video repost checking (and get my gaming PC back).  To make this possible I had to buy another server to pick up the slack. 

The new server was a cost of $765 out of pocket.  IMO it's money well spent since it will enable the bot to have a much greater capacity.

I don't have a problem spending the money because I love working on the bot.  However, I'm not opposed to community support if the want is there.
